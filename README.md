# Annotator

Paragraph-level live annnotations.

### How to use

At the bottom of the page you want to use annotations on, add the following
`<script />` tags:

```
<script src="https://cdn.firebase.com/js/client/1.0.21/firebase.js"></script>
<script src="annotator.js"></script>
```

### TODO

* Linebreaks and styling
* Timestamps
* Inject jQuery and Firebase into the webpage, instead of expecting it's
  already there (jQuery) or separately adding it (Firebase)
* Export of all comments
